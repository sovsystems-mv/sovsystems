# Part 1: Structural Red Flags

## Red Flag #1: Binary Contrast Addiction

AI can't resist "it's not X, it's Y":
- "success isn't about working hard, it's about working smart"
- "content isn't about quantity, it's about quality"
- "marketing isn't selling, it's storytelling"

**Fix:** Say what you mean directly. Use specific details instead of broad contrasts.

## Red Flag #2: Triple Threat Syndrome

AI groups things in threes everywhere:
- "fast, efficient, reliable"
- "boost engagement, increase conversions, maximize roi"
- "powerful, simple, transformative"

**Fix:** Vary your rhythm. Sometimes two. Sometimes four. Sometimes just one.

## Red Flag #3: Infomercial Transitions

Cringe questions AI thinks create "engagement":
- "the catch?"
- "want to know the secret?"
- "the brutal truth?"
- "here's the kicker"

**Fix:** If you wouldn't say it in real conversation, don't write it.

## Red Flag #4: Corporate Verb Disease

Stuffy -ing verbs:
- "...highlighting the benefits..."
- "...emphasizing critical importance..."
- "...facilitating better outcomes..."

**Fix:** Use simple, active verbs. "show" not "highlighting." "help" not "facilitating."

## Red Flag #5: Hedging Language

AI loves to clear its throat:
- "it's worth considering..."
- "you might want to think about..."
- "it's important to note that..."

**Fix:** State your opinion. Skip the diplomatic warm-up.

## Red Flag #6: Thesaurus Abuse

Fancy words that should be simple:
- "utilize" → use
- "execute" → do
- "facilitate" → help
- "implement" → start
- "optimize" → improve
- "leverage" → use

**Fix:** Write like you talk.

---

# Part 2: Formatting Giveaways

## Red Flag #7: Arrow Obsession

AI discovered → and won't let go:
- → 10x your results
- → scale faster than ever
- → join today

**Fix:** Use arrows sparingly. One per post maximum.

## Red Flag #8: Emoji Explosion

ChatGPT treats emojis like confetti:
- 🚀 boost productivity now!
- 💡 revolutionary new approach!
- ⭐ transform your business!

**Fix:** One emoji per section. Maybe. Or none.

## Red Flag #9: Em Dash Overdose

AI loves: "this approach—which many experts recommend—can transform your business—if you're willing to put in the work—and see real results."

**Fix:** Mix your punctuation. Commas exist. Periods too.

# Part 3: Phrase Patterns That Scream "Robot"

## Pattern #1: "No X. No Y. Just Z."

- "no fluff. no theory. just actionable insights."
- "no gimmicks. no shortcuts. just results."

**Fix:** Literally any other sentence structure.

## Pattern #2: "The game has changed"

And its cousins:
- "game-changer"
- "supercharge your [thing]"
- "this changed everything"

**Fix:** Describe actual change without hyperbole.

## Pattern #3: "Real" Overload

"just real strategy from real experts getting real results with real entrepreneurs."

**Fix:** Show authenticity through specific examples, not by repeating "real."

## Pattern #4: The Serious Pitch

"if you're serious about [goal], let's [cta]"

Every AI-written CTA uses this exact structure.

**Fix:** Vary your calls to action. Be specific about what happens next.

## Pattern #5: "To Your Success"

Email sign-offs like this instantly reveal AI authorship.

**Fix:** Sign off like a human. "cheers," "talk soon," or just your name.

## Pattern #6: Profound But Obvious

"not because of X. but because of Y"
- "i didn't succeed because of luck. but because of hard work."

**Fix:** If everyone already knows it, don't package it as insight.

## Pattern #7: Short Hook Questions

- "the best part?"
- "want access?"
- "ready to level up?"

**Fix:** Ask real questions that require thought to answer.

## Pattern #8: "Enter: [Thing]"

- "enter: my revolutionary framework"
- "enter: the solution you've been searching for"

**Fix:** Just introduce the thing normally.

## Pattern #9: "Stopped Me in My Tracks"

"yesterday my mentor said something that stopped me in my tracks:"

**Fix:** Describe actual impact without melodrama.

---

# Part 4: Content Red Flags

## Red Flag #10: Symbol Obsession

AI loves telling you what things "represent" instead of what happened:
- "this symbolizes..."
- "which reflects..."
- "emphasizing the importance of..."

**Fix:** Say what happened. Say what you learned. Skip the literary analysis.

## Red Flag #11: The Generic Case Study

When AI lacks real data, it invents people. Usually named Sarah Chen.

**Fix:** Use actual examples from your life. Real names (with permission). Real numbers.

## Red Flag #12: Everything Changed

- "the strategy that changed everything"
- "this one shift transformed my entire business"

**Fix:** Describe specific changes with specific metrics.
